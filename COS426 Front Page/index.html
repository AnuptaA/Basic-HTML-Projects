            <h1> Syllabus </h1>
            <h4> Description </h4>
            <p> Computer graphics is the intersection of computer science, geometry,
                physics, and art. This course will study topics in this broad and 
                remarkable field, with an emphasis on practical methods and 
                applications. In particular, the course will provide an extensive 
                introduction to image processing, modeling, rendering, and computer
                animation. The goal of this course is to equip students with the 
                various tools and techniques they need to build large projects with 
                significant graphical components; this includes applications for 
                realizing artistic visions (art and architecture), user interaction 
                (UI/UX development), entertainment products (video games, CGI, 
                animations, and augmented reality), visualizations and academic 
                research (physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and other 
                disciplines), etc.
            </p> <br>
            <p> Topics include: color theory, sampling, image processing, image 
                compositing, mesh representations, mesh processing, parametric 
                curves and surfaces, implicit surfaces, subdivision surfaces, 
                geometric data structures, geometric transformations, ray casting, 
                lighting and reflectance, global illumination, rasterization, scan
                conversion, particle systems, animation, computer games, 
                fabrication, etc.
            </p> <br>
            <h4> Prerequisites </h4>
            <p> The course is appropriate for students who have taken COS 217 and 
                COS 226 (or equivalent). JavaScript will be the main programming 
                language; however no prior knowledge of the language is required for
                students who wish to enroll in this course.
            </p> <br>
            <h4> Lectures and Precepts </h4>
            <p> Lectures are held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:00–4:20PM over 
                Zoom.
            </p> <br>
            <p> Precept is held on Wednesday and Thursday from 7:30–8:20PM over 
                Zoom. Students may attend either (or both) during any week, 
                regardless of their registration. In general, precept attendance is
                highly encouraged.</p> <br>
            <h4> Required Reading </h4>
            <p> There is one required textbook for this course: </p> <br>
            <p style="text-align: center"> <i> Computer Graphics with OpenGL</i>, 
                4th Ed., Hearn, Baker, and Carithers. Prentice Hall, 2010. ISBN:
                978-0136053583.
            </p> <br>
            <p> In the past, most students have found it is possible to pass the 
                course without opening the textbook once, as almost all graded 
                material is provided through lecture and precepts; nevertheless, 
                this textbook will prove extremely useful for especially eager and 
                motivated students who wish to pursue further studies in computer 
                graphics. In addition to covering graphics concepts that could not 
                otherwise squeeze into this course, the textbook contains wonderful 
                C++ and OpenGL implementations that all graphics programmers would 
                be well-suited to know.</p>

            <h1> Precepts </h1>
            <p> The precepts for this class follow the “flipped classroom” 
                methodology and serve to assist students with their assignments.
                During the first 10–15 minutes of precept, instructors briefly 
                review precept materials with the entire class; these precept 
                materials generally consist of “tips and tricks” slides for 
                current assignment. It is highly recommended that students read
                through an assignment’s precept slides (in their entirety) 
                before starting work on the assignment itself.
            </p> <br>
            <p> Following review, the precept then turns into a <b>problem 
                session</b>, during which instructors are available as LabTAs 
                to answer students’ questions individually and to provide
                personal assignment troubleshooting. </p>

            <h4> Expectations </h4>
            <p> COS 426 is a 400-level class. For students concentrating in 
                Computer Science, this course will be marked as a senior 
                departmental on their transcript. Accordingly, students should 
                not only expect to be held to higher standards, but should also 
                expect less hand-holding in general than they may find in 
                300-level courses and below.
            </p> <br>
            <p> In particular, students should not expect LabTAs to give them 
                the answer to an assignment problem after enough pestering. 
                Course staff are available to help students with their learning,
                not their grade. Here is a list of what instructors can help 
                with:
            </p> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Course staff are happy to help explain course concepts or 
                    general techniques that students may be confused about.
                    <ul>
                        <li> e.g. “Could you please explain image 
                             convolution?”</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Course staff are happy to clarify assignment specs, provided
                    the clarification is not about an intentional ambiguity.
                    <ul>
                        <li> e.g. “Should this filter rotate the image clockwise
                             or counterclockwise?”</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Course staff are happy to give the occasional starting hint
                    (but no more) to put students on the right track for a 
                    certain problem.
                    <ul>
                        <li> e.g. “The runtime of the brush filter should not 
                            exceed 4r^2 per center.”</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Course staff are happy to answer questions about JavaScript 
                    syntax.
                    <ul>
                        <li> “How can I iterate over entries in an Object?” </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Course staff will give modest debugging assistance only once
                    students have demonstrated that they understand the 
                    solution to a problem at a high level (in other words, after
                    students explain what they are trying to do, and that 
                    explanation is correct).
                </li>
